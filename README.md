### About
- Despite it's ugly interface, I assure you, it's still not worth using
- There's plenty of obtuse, tiny bugs that don't break anything, just make it less usable, stop being obtuse
- Other than those points, on the plus side, it's completely free and new features are hard to add because the code makes no sense
- If that doesn't make you love it, it's also written in Java, notoriously not-as-slow-as-it-used-to-be, and I still use Swing which is deprecated. I also use Java2D which I'm pretty sure is older than me

### Dependencies
- !(https://github.com/fangyidong/json-simple "JSON.Simple")
	- Provides simple tools for reading and writing JSON files
- !(https://github.com/google/gson "GSon ")
	- JSON.Simple doesn't format the JSON when writing out to look "pretty", GSon is used since it does have that feature
- !(https://www.lwjgl.org/download "LWJGL") 
	- the entire LWJGL library is needed, it can be a pain to setup, there are great guides on google like this one: http://thecodinguniverse.com/lwjgl-workspace/
- !(https://github.com/bobbylight/RSyntaxTextArea "RSyntaxTextArea")
	- This is really cool, it's a text area which handles syntax highlighting completely for you.
- !(https://github.com/bobbylight/AutoComplete "RSyntaxTextArea - AutoComplete")
	- Another really cool tool which attaches to RSyntaxTextArea which allows for auto-completion
