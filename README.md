### Dependencies
- Slick2D build 237 (2D game framework build on LWJGL, comes with LWJGL or LWJGL can be downloaded separately)
	- I recommend downloading LWJGL separately simply because on the site for LWJGL you have the option to include JOML and Steamworks4j)
- LWJGL 3.1.1 (OpenGL library)
- Jasypt 1.9.2 (Encryption library)
- JOML v1.9.2 (can be included with LWJGL download)
- Steamworks4j v1.6.1 (can be included with LWJGL download)

Note: It's probably perfectly fine to use different versions, naturally it just means that using older versions might be missing some features or newer features might remove features, of course.
