### Dependencies
- JSON.Simple https://github.com/fangyidong/json-simple
	- Provides simple tools for reading and writing JSON files
- GSon https://github.com/google/gson
	- JSON.Simple doesn't format the JSON when writing out to look "pretty", GSon is used since it does have that feature
- LWJGL https://www.lwjgl.org/download
	- the entire LWJGL library is needed, it can be a pain to setup, there are great guides on google like this one: http://thecodinguniverse.com/lwjgl-workspace/
