### About
- A 2D level editor that is slowly turning in to a 2D game engine, all though I'm not optimistic that it will ever be completed, it is still in progress

### Version 0.0 Build 3 Release Notes

- Decal properties panel with rotation and rotation speed
- Working on graph editing for sound and light fall off
- Settings dialog to be built
- Updated structure to allow multiple scenes
- Rudimentary script editor
- Start of build and run process

### Dependencies
- [JSON.Simple](https://github.com/fangyidong/json-simpl)
	- Provides simple tools for reading and writing JSON files
- [GSon](https://github.com/google/gson)
	- JSON.Simple doesn't format the JSON when writing out to look "pretty", GSon is used since it does have that feature
- [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/download)
	- the entire LWJGL library is needed, it can be a pain to setup, there are great guides on google like this one: http://thecodinguniverse.com/lwjgl-workspace/
- [RSyntaxTextArea](https://github.com/bobbylight/RSyntaxTextArea)
	- This is really cool, it's a text area which handles syntax highlighting completely for you.
- [RSyntaxTextArea - AutoComplete](https://github.com/bobbylight/AutoComplete)
	- Another really cool tool which attaches to RSyntaxTextArea which allows for auto-completion
